<ul>
<li>Bandit Queens by Parini Shroff: A non-fiction book from my book club. Story of a band of women from a village in India who decide to get rid of their husbands. Nice read with some social commentry.</li>
<li>Think Again by Adam Grant: A nice and quick read. The book is divided into three sections.Â Â The first section is about Individual Rethinking(Are you a preacher, a politician, or a prosecutor, you should be a scientific thinker instead and embrace Joy of being wrong). The second section of the book focuses on Interpersonal Rethinking(debates, persuasion). The third section of the book is on Collective Rethinking(education, and work).</li>
<li>The Time Machine by H.G. Wells(Listening): Listened on Apple books. Classic book and liked the themes explored in this masterpiece.</li>
<li>The Alchemist by Paulo Cahelo(Re-Read): Re-Read this book after almost 20 years. This book has a flow and touch many themes. There are lots of interesting nuggets in this book. Was able to see the biases clearly too.</li>
<li>The Stranger by Albert Camus: This book is mind blowing. I listened to this as an audiobook but bought the physical book too. Albert Camus masterpiece is a master class in Absurdism. I had to read Sartre commentry to find some of the themes in this book.</li>
<li>The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran: Really nice prose and paintings in this book.</li>
</ul>
