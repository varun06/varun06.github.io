Go language has this definition on [golang](http://http://golang.org/):
> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

If you have worked with C family languages (such as C, C++, Java, Python etc.) Go will look familiar to you. I have been working with python from some time and wanted to learn a static typed language. Go is easy to learn and you can start writing code very soon.

I started with [go language tour](http://tour.golang.org/#1) and learned the sytax and semantics of the language. After that I started looking at [go language documentation](http://golang.org/doc/).
One of the best way to learn about a programming language is to look at the code written by other people in that language. So I choose [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) to read the code.

This is just the start and I will be writing more about my learnings on go programming.
