Rebecca even talked about when to use micro-services. She suggested that if you are building a new system you should start with a monolith architecture but with good design and then move to micro-services. If you start with micro services, you might define the boundaries of your system wrong.

<p>This was a great conference but <strong>diversity</strong> is still an issue for software industry. There were very few women in audience/speakers. This is a big issue and some speakers even pointed out on stage too. So we all need to work towards making software engineering a more diverse place.</p>
