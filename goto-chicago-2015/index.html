<p>This week I went to GOTO Chicago conference. It was held in Westin hotel on Clark street. The conference was on 11th and 12th May 2015. GOTO is an yearly conference and has been going on from some time. My employer sponsored the conference also.</p>

<p>It was a great conference and had a mix of talks on Programming Languages, Distributed Computing, Testing, General (Agile) etc. I attended bunch of talks delivered by some wonderful speakers.</p>

<p><strong>How I finally stopped worrying and learnt to love Conway’s Law by James Lewis(<a href="https://twitter.com/boicy">@boicy</a>)</strong>
<strong>Evolutionary Architecture &amp; Micro-Services - A Match Enabled by Continuous Delivery by Rebecca Parsons(<a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccaparsons">@rebeccaparsons</a>)</strong> - Both of these talks were about Micro-services architecture and how organizations can benefit with Micro-services. Rebecca even talked about when to use micro-services. She suggested that if you are building a new system you should start with a monolith architecture but with good design and then move to micro-services. If you start with micro services, you might define the boundaries of your system wrong.

<p><strong>End-to-end Encryption in Cloud Services by Patrick Linskey</strong> - This is the talk that I could not understand much. Speaker tried his best but either crypto is hard or end to end encryption is very hard. <a href="http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-2015/slides/PatrickLinskey_EndToEndEncryptionInCloudServices.pdf">Slides</a></p>

<p><strong>Level Up Your Automated Tests by Trisha Gee(<a href="https://twitter.com/trisha_gee">@trisha_gee</a>)</strong> - This was one of the talk from testing track. Trisha talked about how to have the culture of writing tests. She said that tests can be used as a documentation also and that resonated very well with everybody in the room. She also gave some examples from her work with Spock and JUnit.
She forgot to charge her laptop and ended up using hand written slides and that was cool. :)

<p><strong>Faster Java Objects by Gil Tene(<a href="https://twitter.com/giltene">@giltene</a>)</strong> -Gil is CTO of Azul systems and talked about faster java objects. Basically they want to have flat memory layout for objects in Java so that they can make them easily streamable. It was a fascinating talk and I learned few things coz I am also working on a problem of reading binary from c structs.

<p><strong>From Homogeneous Monolith to Radically Heterogeneous Microservices: The Wunderlist 3 Story by Chad Fowler(<a href="https://twitter.com/chadfowler">@chadfowler</a>)</strong> - A fun ending keynote from Chad. He talked about how he changed Wunderlist from a monolith to micro services. He talked about clean architecture and how it is important to keep complexity in check in a system. He also talked about how we should take inspiration from our own system(body) and build a system that heal itself.

<p>This was a great conference but <strong>diversity</strong> is still an issue for software industry. There were very few women in audience/speakers. This is a big issue and some speakers even pointed out on stage too. So we all need to work towards making software engineering a more diverse place.</p>
