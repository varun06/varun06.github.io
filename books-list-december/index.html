    <ul>
<li><strong>Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</strong> - I read this book as part of my local book clubâ€™s reading. I had known about this book for a long time and wanted to read it. I loved the way Andy Weir added real science to the narrative of the book. I liked that in The Martian and liked that in this book too. Itâ€™s a long book, but I read it as a page-turner and couldnâ€™t keep it down. Overall, a really great sci-fi read.</li>
<li><strong>My Gita by Devdutt Pattanaik</strong> - I have been interested in reading the Gita for some time. This book is not the Gita but a POV of the author on the Gita. This book also provides a summary and big ideas of the Gita in a concise way. This book gave me an idea about the big themes of the Gita.</li>
<li><strong>An Immense World(Listening on Libby)</strong> - This is another science book that I read. This book deals with species that share the world with humans and how human activities are impacting those species. Very informative and interesting read.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear War: A Scenario by Annie Jacobsen</strong> - Another page-turner. Scary but really informative book. The author used an interesting narrative choice. The book starts with a really scary(but plausible) scenario and then plays it out in small chunks. Once you start reading, you canâ€™t put this book down. This book also makes you realize the dangers of nuclear war(if you arenâ€™t already).</li>
<li><strong>Stiff by Mary Roach(Listening on Libby)</strong> - Last month I listened to Gulp by Mary Roach; this month it was Stiff. Another science book about the human body after death. The book talks about how human cadavers are used to do science and how helpful they are. Real good read and learned some new things.</li>
<li><strong>Feel Good Productivity by Ali Abdaal (Listening on Libby)</strong> - A self-help book written in an exceptionally simple and informative manner. Iâ€™ve watched a few of Aliâ€™s YouTube videos and found his delivery style engaging. The book maintains this same level of quality and I thoroughly enjoyed what he had to say.</li>
<li><strong>Chatter by Ethan Kross (Listening on Libby)</strong> - This book delves into the concept of the human inner voice, which serves as an internal evaluator of the past and a preparatory mechanism for the future. However, this voice can also pose challenges and hinder our progress. The book explores the duality of the chatter, examining how it can be both a catalyst for positive change and a source of self-sabotage. Additionally, it offers practical strategies to harness the power of the inner voice and leverage its potential for personal growth and fulfillment.</li>
