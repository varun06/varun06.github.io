    <p>Go language has this definition on <a href="http://http://golang.org/">golang</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have worked with C family languages (such as C, C++, Java, Python etc.) Go will look familiar to you. I have been working with python from some time and wanted to learn a static typed language. Go is easy to learn and you can start writing code very soon.</p>
<p>I started with <a href="http://tour.golang.org/#1">go language tour</a> and learned the sytax and semantics of the language. After that I started looking at <a href="http://golang.org/doc/">go language documentation</a>.
One of the best way to learn about a programming language is to look at the code written by other people in that language. So I choose <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> to read the code.</p>
<p>This is just the start and I will be writing more about my learnings on go programming.</p>
