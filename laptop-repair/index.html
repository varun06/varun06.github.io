    <p>I haven&rsquo;t published anything on my blog because my personal laptop was having some issues. It is a mid 2012 retina Macbook Pro and I have it from last 4 years. It was <code>kernel panicking</code> and restarting every 5 minutes or so. I took it to Apple store and they ran some hardware tests. First they reinstalled the operating system and it did not help. I took it back for repair and they replaced the <code>logic board</code>. Apple charged a flat fee of <code>$310 + tax</code> for repairs. After repairs, laptop is working fine and I should be back to blooging now.</p>
