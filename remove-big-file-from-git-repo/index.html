    <p>Sometimes you push a big binary/text(etc.) file to your git repo and these files stay in your git history. Your repo size go to roof and it takes time to clone that repo, which is a big pain. One of my git repo at work had a big binary(logstash deb file) in history and it was inflating the repo size to over 80mb. So I thought of cleaning the repo and bring down the size. I am sure there are many ways to do it but I am going to write down what I did so somebody else can also benefit.</p>
<p>I used a tool called <strong>BFG Repo cleaner</strong>. BFG cleans bad data from git repo. BFG can be downloaded <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.12.13/bfg-1.12.13.jar">here</a> and provides a comprehensive list of option to clean git repo. It is an alternative to <code>git-filter-branch</code>, which I have no idea about.</p>
<p>To use BFG on a git repo follow these steps:</p>
<p>First clone a fresh copy of your repo, using the <code>--mirror</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone --mirror git://github.com/big-repo.git
</code></pre><p>Run the BFG to clean any big file that has a size greater then 100mb:</p>
<pre><code>$ java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M big-repo.git
</code></pre><p>Or, if you know the name of file, you can give the name too:</p>
<pre><code>$ java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files file_name  big-repo.git 
</code></pre><p>After running the command above, BFG will update your commits and all branches and tags so they are clean, but it doesn&rsquo;t physically delete the unwanted stuff. Examine the repo to make sure your history has been updated, and then use the standard <code>git gc</code> command to strip out the unwanted dirty data, which Git will now recognise as surplus to requirements:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd big-repo 
$ git reflog expire --expire=now --all &amp;&amp; git gc --prune=now --aggressive
</code></pre><p>Finally, once you&rsquo;re happy with the updated state of your repo, push it back up (note that because your clone command used the <code>--mirror</code> flag, this push will update all refs on your remote server):</p>
<pre><code>$ git push
</code></pre><p>Once you push new and clean history to your repo, ditch old copies of the repo and then fresh clone/fork. Delete the old clones as they have dirty history, if you have some PR&rsquo;s, fetch them from master or cherry pick the commits you want.</p>
<p>After all these your repo size should be significantly lower. In my case, I brought the size down from 82mb to 4.1mb.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any question or suggestions.</p>
