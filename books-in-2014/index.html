    <p>I read 7 books (and ton of artilcles in <a href="http://getpocket.com/">pockets</a> app) this year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most of the books that I read were technical ranging on different topics. I read couple of physics books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DFL353K/">Hidden In Plain Sight 2: The Equation of the Universe</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Particles-Universe-Jeff-Yee-ebook/dp/B007PM4ZZW">The particles of universe</a>.</p>
<p>I read one fiction book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lethal-Code-Lana-Elkins-Thriller-ebook/dp/B00J9P2EMO/">Lethal Code</a>, which I didn&rsquo;t like much. It had a great promise but writing could have been better.</p>
<p>For 2015, I am planning to read at least 15 books and will try to add some variety this time. I want to read some good fiction, non-fiction, science, technology books. I also have a backlog of 4-5 books that I need to finish this year.</p>
