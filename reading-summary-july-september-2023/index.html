<p>Gunaho ka devta by Dharamveer Bharti: I have been trying to read more hindi literature lately. This is one of the books that I picked from India. This book is about love and Indian society at that time. The story touches on many themes such as castiesm, communism etc. I liked the writing a lot, but lost interest in story. I am not a big fan of romantic novel and non-fiction. Overall, great writing but didn&rsquo;t like the story much.</p>
