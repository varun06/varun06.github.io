      <description>A good primer on how to write network programs using Go programming language. Author starts by talking about TCP/IP, UDP, and other networking stuff. Once the basic theory is out of way, author builds network services using TCP and UDP. In later chapters, author talks about deployment, cloud, and observability for services.
Overall, I liked this book a lot and learned a few things too. Writing style is very approachable and fun.</description>
