      <description>When we write a file, how we make sure that file is written completely to disk. One of the way is write a temporary file first and then rename it, rename operation is atomic, so we get a complete file.
tempFile, err := ioutil.TempFile(path, name) if err != nil { return err } defer tempFile.Close() tempname := tempFile.Name() defer os.Remove(tempname) //Write to temp file err = os.Rename(tempname, filename) if err !</description>

      <description>Failure is a way of life. Requests(http or others..) can fail for many reasons. Decision to stop or retry can be very critical for applications. backoff algorithms provide a way to backoff and retry on a failure. There are two popular methods to backoff, constant backoff and exponential backoff.
I use backoff library, which is a Go port of exponential backoff algorithm from Google&amp;rsquo;s HTTP Client Library for Java.
backoff provides 4 main functionalities.</description>
