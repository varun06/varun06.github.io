      <description>I have been working from home for last 4 years. Initially I thought that I can get by a laptop and couch. But that&amp;rsquo;s not how it played out. Very soon I realized that I need to have a proper home office setup if I want to work from home for a long duration. And here I am after 4 years. I have acquired quite a few things, and this is a running list of that.</description>
