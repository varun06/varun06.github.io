      <description>standard streams are pre connected input and output communication channels between a program and its environment.
The three standard streams are stdin, stdout, and stderr.
File descriptors are handles that are used to access an input or output file, stream, pipe, socket, device, network interface etc. File descriptors work by providing a layer of abstraction between an actual hardware device and a special file created by the kernel for the device, populated by udev, and stored in the /dev directory.</description>

      <description>Exit codes in bash indicate the previous command&amp;rsquo;s termination status. 0 indicates that command completion was successful while 1 indicates that command execution failed.
We can check the exit code generated by last command by using $?
$ echo $? It&amp;rsquo;s not only 1 that indicates unsuccessful completion, anything greater than 1 is a sign of command failure. Standard error code are listed here:
   Exit Code Description     0 Successful execution   1 Unsuccessful execution catchall   2 Incorrect use of shell builtin   126 Command can not execute   127 Command not Found   128 Incorrect exit code argument   128 + num Fatal error signal &amp;ldquo;num&amp;rdquo;   130 Script killed with CTRL + C   255+ Exit code is out of range    Note: Exit code is an integer value between 0 and/or 255.</description>
