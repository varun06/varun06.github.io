      <description>Shoe Dog is memoir by Nike founder Phil Knight. Book talks about how he founded Blue Ribbons and then fought for the company. How Nike got its signature shoes and what else happened in this journey.
Things I liked Book is exhaustive and talks about both successes and failures. Language of the book is easy and there is a flow to the story.

      <description>A good primer on how to write network programs using Go programming language. Author starts by talking about TCP/IP, UDP, and other networking stuff. Once the basic theory is out of way, author builds network services using TCP and UDP. In later chapters, author talks about deployment, cloud, and observability for services.
Overall, I liked this book a lot and learned a few things too. Writing style is very approachable and fun.</description>

      <description>The premise of the book is to draw lessons from software engineering at google and present them in a digestible manner, this book does a good job of that. . Chapters in this book are written by a different people from Google(ex-Google) and that brings a fresh perspective to this book.
The book reintroduces the term engineering with a new definition: programming integrated over time, or how to make software programs stand the test of time.</description>
