      <description>November 2024  Hatchet by Paulson(Listening): A book about surviving wilderness. It was a good listen.

Elon Musk by Walter Issacson: Elon Musk is all the rage now a days and this book added some context to Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s story. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the writing much in this book though.</description>
