      <description>Go 1.18 adds workspace mode to Go, which lets you work on multiple modules simultaneously.
Workspaces
Go workspaces helps to work with several modules in a Go project. When you create a go.work file, Go runs through the list of modules listed in the workspace, and creates a single list of dependencies. If go.mod files have replace directives, Go will also take them into account.
The go.work file has use and replace directives that override the individual go.</description>
