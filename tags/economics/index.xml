      <description>I was looking to read a book about economics from some time. I came across this book and immediately picked it up. I am really glad that I decided to read this book. This book is one of the most concise and thoughful work on economics.
summary of the book: Thoughts Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek said, there is &amp;ldquo;no other modern book from which the intelligent layman can learn so much about the basic truths of economics in so short a time.</description>
