      <title>Reselect Last Visual Selection in Vim</title>

      <description>Vim has three different visual modes to work with characters, lines, or rectangle blocks of text. We can switch between these modes by pressing v, V, or &amp;lt;ctrl-v&amp;gt; respectively.
Many a times, we select something and press ESC by mistake, it is annoying to reselect the whole block of text again by pressing v/V. Vim provides a command gv to reselect the range of text that was selected. Command gv works for all the visual modes.</description>

      <description>Vim is a text editor that keeps surprising you. The more you learn about vim, there is always more to learn. One of the feature that I keep using and find very interesting is incrementing/decrementing a number in current line. Vim has &amp;lt;ctrl-a&amp;gt; to increment a number and &amp;lt;ctrl-x&amp;gt; to decrement a number. Just go to a line with number in it and hit &amp;lt;ctrl-a&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;ctrl-x&amp;gt; to increment/decrement. But because it is vim, there is definitely more to this command.</description>
