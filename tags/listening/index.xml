      <description>November 2024  Hatchet by Paulson(Listening): A book about surviving wilderness. It was a good listen. Same as every by Morgan Housel(Listening): Lots of great insight in this book. Had a fun time with this one. Existentialism is humanism by Jean Paul Sartre: I came to know about Sartre after reading The Stranger by Albert Camus. It was interesting to read about a great philospher and thinker. In the beginning..was command line by Neal Stephenson: An ode to command line and old school computing.</description>
