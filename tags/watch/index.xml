      <description>I watched this great video where Joe Armstrong interviews Alan Kay. This is a great video and both Alan Kay and Joe Armstrong talk about some real issues in current computer science. They both are not fond of cloud and internet of things.
Both Alan Kay and Joe Armstrong want computer science people to understand history and build things that matter. They don&amp;rsquo;t want people to do things just for the sake of doing them(I am looking at you Javascript frameworks).</description>
