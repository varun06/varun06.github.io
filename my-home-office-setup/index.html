    <p>I have been working from home for last 4 years. Initially I thought that I can get by a laptop and couch. But that&rsquo;s not how it played out. Very soon I realized that I need to have a proper home office setup if I want to work from home for a long duration. And here I am after 4 years. I have acquired quite a few things, and this is a running list of that.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">Ergodox EZ Glow</a> as my keyboard. I started feeling some stiffness in my upper back and neck last year. After consulting doctor and bunch of x-rays, I decided that it was time to change my posture and use ergonomic accessories. This keyboard has been life saver. It some getting used to it, but I am back to my normal 55-60 WPM now. I also got interviewed by ergodox team and here is that interview - <a href="https://people.ergodox-ez.com/varun-saini/">Varun Saini</a></p>
