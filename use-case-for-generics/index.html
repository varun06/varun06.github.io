    <p>This is an <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/experiencereports">experience report</a> about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generics</a> in <a href="https://golang.org/">go</a> could have helped us in one of our use case. There is a lot that can be/has been said about <code>generics</code> is <code>go</code>. I am going to keep this post short and simple and going to document a use case where I think <code>generics</code> in go might have been useful for us.</p>
<p>I like how easy it is to build command line applications in <code>go</code>, We have a common framework for building command line apps. Different command line applications need to have different configuration, that are passed to common framework. This is where the need for <code>generics</code> pop up, as you can see <code>Configuration</code> type(in code below) is an <code>interface{}</code> and we need to do <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_assertions">Type Assertion</a> such as <code>cfg := configuration.(*appConfig)</code>, to get the application configuration.</p>
<pre><code>type (
	//Configuration is a marker interface to use because we don't have generics
	//It is used when passing a configuration object around
	Configuration interface{}

	//Application is a struct that holds the definition of the application to run
	Application struct {
		Name          string
		Description   string
		Version       string
		Options       []cli.Flag
		Subcommands   []cli.Command
		Configuration Configuration
	}
)
</code></pre><p>If <code>go</code> had generics, we could have a generic type instead of an <code>interface{}</code> for the Configuration type.</p>
