Career fairs are a good way to meet college graduates who are looking for internship or full time opportunities. I have been to many career fairs and we found some really good engineers(some of them are my colleagues) there. But some time back I noticed that there are lots of students looking for data science or data analysts roles(both internship or full time). Even this year, I have been to two career fairs and I am amazed how many students wants to be data scientists or data analysts. I asked many current students why they want to be a data scientist or some time even &ldquo;What is data science&rdquo; but most of the time they don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is the reason and that&rsquo;s why I thought of asking smart people&hellip;.</p>
