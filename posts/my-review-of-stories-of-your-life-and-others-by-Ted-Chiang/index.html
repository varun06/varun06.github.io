                    <p>I came to know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang">Ted Chiang</a> and his work after movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/">Arrival</a>. I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0048EKOP0/">The story of your life and others</a> on kindle to give it a read. I like sci-fi and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. This book is not your everyday bad alien fighting book. This book has 8 short stories and every story is different. I am listing the stories from book below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Story of your life - My favorite story and Arrival movie is based on this story. In this story a linguist tries to communicate with aliens. Story is about how it works and impacts her life and people around her. A fascinating story and you need to give couple of read to understand everything that is going on in the story.</li>
<li>Tower of Babylon - My second favorite story from the book, this story make you think about religion and religious beliefs. I still can&rsquo;t visualize how that tower was built, but it is a sci-fi for a reason.</li>
<li>Liking What you see: A Documentary - This short story asks a question &ldquo;what will happen if everybody looks same&rdquo;. Very interesting read and I will love to see this turned into a movie.</li>
<li>Division by Zero - How a mathematician goes insane when she finds that she can prove something that deemed impossible in mathematics. Another great read.</li>
<li>Hell is the absence of God - Another sci-fi story that asks questions about religious beliefs. This story also has angels.</li>
<li>Understand - A therapy gone wrong and we have a super human with high cognitive functioning.</li>
<li>Seventy-Two letters - Story about magic and robots.</li>
<li>The Evolution of Human Science - As the name says, a short sci-fi story about the evolution of human science.</li>
</ol>

<p>I liked this book very much and I am looking forward to read more from Ted Chiang.</p>
