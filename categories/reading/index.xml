      <description>I really like Aeon magazine. Every weekend I get aeon newsletter and there is always some really good article/essay in newsletter. One of these essay that I read today is why there is no place like home anymore.This is a really thought provoking essay.
Essay starts by talking about Tiny Homes that I saw some time back. Tiny home is an interesting concept but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that you can also save tax on them.</description>

      <description>This week again I read more that 20 articles. I have a good mix of long form reading and quick reading articles. I read way more general(Science, Society etc.) compare to technical articles. Again Pocket app was handy to keep the articles saved for me.This logging has helped me in finding that I am reading a lot of stuff. I also have some books to read, so I might not read these many articles going forward and finish my books first.</description>
