      <title>unmarshal to map</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you unmarhsal json to a map, always pass the reference to map object. This is very subtle and I fixed two bugs last week related to same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var m map[string]string
err := json.Unmarshal(data, m)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code snippet above will not fail/err. But when you look at m, you will get nothing. To fix this, we need to pass the reference to m in &lt;code&gt;json.Unmarshal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var m map[string]string
err := json.Unmarshal(data, &amp;amp;m)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hiring is a difficult problem to solve(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/why-is-it-so-hard-to-hire-great-people/277122/&#34;&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/why-is-it-so-hard-to-hire-great-people/277122/&lt;/a&gt;). Career fairs are a good way to meet college graduates who are looking for internship or full time opportunities. I have been to many career fairs and we found some really good engineers(some of them are my colleagues) there. But some time back I noticed that there are lots of students looking for data science or data analysts roles(both internship or full time). Even this year, I have been to two career fairs and I am amazed how many students wants to be data scientists or data analysts. I asked many current students why they want to be a data scientist or some time even &amp;ldquo;What is data science&amp;rdquo; but most of the time they don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is the reason and that&amp;rsquo;s why I thought of asking smart people&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
