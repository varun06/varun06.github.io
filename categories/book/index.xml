This topics talked about in the book can not be more timely. Automation is coming and turning out to be a job killer. So the book talk about some of the actions that can be taken to help society in general.</description>

      <description>I came to know about Ted Chiang and his work after movie Arrival. I bought The story of your life and others on kindle to give it a read. I like sci-fi and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. This book is not your everyday bad alien fighting book. This book has 8 short stories and every story is different. I am listing the stories from book below.
 Story of your life - My favorite story and Arrival movie is based on this story.</description>
