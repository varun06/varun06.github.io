      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came to know about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang&#34;&gt;Ted Chiang&lt;/a&gt; and his work after movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/&#34;&gt;Arrival&lt;/a&gt;. I bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0048EKOP0/&#34;&gt;The story of your life and others&lt;/a&gt; on kindle to give it a read. I like sci-fi and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. This book is not your everyday bad alien fighting book. This book has 8 short stories and every story is different. I am listing the stories from book below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story of your life - My favorite story and Arrival movie is based on this story. In this story a linguist tries to communicate with aliens. Story is about how it works and impacts her life and people around her. A fascinating story and you need to give couple of read to understand everything that is going on in the story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tower of Babylon - My second favorite story from the book, this story make you think about religion and religious beliefs. I still can&amp;rsquo;t visualize how that tower was built, but it is a sci-fi for a reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liking What you see: A Documentary - This short story asks a question &amp;ldquo;what will happen if everybody looks same&amp;rdquo;. Very interesting read and I will love to see this turned into a movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Division by Zero - How a mathematician goes insane when she finds that she can prove something that deemed impossible in mathematics. Another great read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hell is the absence of God - Another sci-fi story that asks questions about religious beliefs. This story also has angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand - A therapy gone wrong and we have a super human with high cognitive functioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seventy-Two letters - Story about magic and robots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Evolution of Human Science - As the name says, a short sci-fi story about the evolution of human science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this book very much and I am looking forward to read more from Ted Chiang.&lt;/p&gt;
