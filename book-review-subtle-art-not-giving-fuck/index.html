    <p>I in fact listened to this book. I borrowed book from library using <strong>Libby</strong> app. I was aware of the app but only started using it recently. This is the first book that I read/listened to. It was not a bad experience, but I still prefer reading physical books and collectiong the good one. Anyway, here is my review of the book, I took some help from ChatGPT for this review.</p>
<p>In the crowded self-help genre, Mark Manson‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck‚Äù stands out with its bold title and unconventional approach. If you‚Äôre tired of the typical ‚Äúthink positive‚Äù mantras, this book might be a breath of fresh air for you. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes this book both a compelling read and a guide worth considering.</p>
<p>A Refreshingly Honest Approach</p>
<p>Manson‚Äôs central premise is straightforward: life is filled with struggles, and the key to living well is not to avoid these struggles but to choose the right ones. Instead of sugar-coating reality with relentless positivity, Manson encourages readers to embrace their limitations and confront the uncomfortable truths about life. This raw honesty is both liberating and refreshing.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<pre><code>1.	Choose Your Struggles: Manson argues that our happiness is determined by the quality of our problems. Instead of trying to avoid problems, we should focus on solving the ones that truly matter to us.
2.	The Importance of Values: At the heart of Manson‚Äôs philosophy is the idea that our values shape our experiences. He urges readers to reflect deeply on their values and to ensure they are grounded in reality and lead to constructive outcomes.
3.	Accepting Responsibility: Manson emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for our lives, even for things that seem beyond our control. This perspective shift can be empowering, as it focuses on what we can change rather than what we can‚Äôt.
4.	The Myth of Exceptionalism: In a world that often promotes the idea that we should all strive to be extraordinary, Manson makes a compelling case for embracing our ordinary selves. He argues that accepting our average nature can lead to greater contentment and personal fulfillment.
</code></pre>
<p>Writing Style</p>
<p>One of the standout features of this book is Manson‚Äôs conversational and often irreverent writing style. He uses humor and profanity liberally, which can be both engaging and polarizing. If you appreciate a no-nonsense, candid tone, you‚Äôll likely find Manson‚Äôs style appealing. However, if you prefer a more formal or gentle approach, this book might take some getting used to.</p>
<p>Criticisms</p>
<p>While ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck‚Äù offers many valuable insights, it isn‚Äôt without its criticisms. Some readers may find Manson‚Äôs repeated use of profanity gratuitous or off-putting. Additionally, the book‚Äôs core ideas, though impactful, can sometimes feel repetitive. Manson‚Äôs approach might also come across as overly cynical to those who lean towards more optimistic self-help philosophies.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck‚Äù is a standout in the self-help genre because it challenges the conventional wisdom of relentless positivity and encourages readers to confront life‚Äôs harsh realities. Mark Manson‚Äôs blend of humor, candor, and practical advice makes this book a thought-provoking and enjoyable read.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a book that offers a different take on personal development‚Äîone that values resilience, grounded values, and the courage to face discomfort‚Äîthis book is worth your time. Just be prepared for some tough love and a fair amount of f-bombs along the way.</p>
