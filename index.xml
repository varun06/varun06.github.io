      <description>Go 1.18 adds workspace mode to Go, which lets you work on multiple modules simultaneously.
Workspaces
Go workspaces helps to work with several modules in a Go project. When you create a go.work file, Go runs through the list of modules listed in the workspace, and creates a single list of dependencies. If go.mod files have replace directives, Go will also take them into account.
The go.work file has use and replace directives that override the individual go.</description>

      <description>A good primer on how to write network programs using Go programming language. Author starts by talking about TCP/IP, UDP, and other networking stuff. Once the basic theory is out of way, author builds network services using TCP and UDP. In later chapters, author talks about deployment, cloud, and observability for services.
Overall, I liked this book a lot and learned a few things too. Writing style is very approachable and fun.</description>

      <description>In Envoy, HTTP lua filter is used to run Lua scripts during both request and response flow. Envoy uses LuaJIT as Lua runtime.
High level design of Lua Filter  All Lua environments are per worker thread. There is no truly global data. All scripts are run as coroutines. Do not perform blocking operations from scripts. It is critical for performance that Envoy APIs are used for all IO.  Features supported by Lua Filter  Inspection of headers, body, and trailers while streaming in either the request flow, response flow, or both.</description>

      <guid>https://varunksaini.com/slice-as-map-keys-in-go/</guid>
      <description>Question: Can we use slice as map key in Go? Short answer is No
Do you want to know more? Okay, Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at spec.
From Map spec:
 The comparison operators == and != must be fully defined for operands of the key type; thus the key type must not be a function, map, or slice.
 Map spec already tells us that slice can&amp;rsquo;t be a key, but we can also check it in the comparison spec:</description>

      <guid>https://varunksaini.com/reselect-last-visual-selection-in-vim/</guid>
      <description>Vim has three different visual modes to work with characters, lines, or rectangle blocks of text. We can switch between these modes by pressing v, V, or &amp;lt;ctrl-v&amp;gt; respectively.
Many a times, we select something and press ESC by mistake, it is annoying to reselect the whole block of text again by pressing v/V. Vim provides a command gv to reselect the range of text that was selected. Command gv works for all the visual modes.</description>

      <description>Vim is a text editor that keeps surprising you. The more you learn about vim, there is always more to learn. One of the feature that I keep using and find very interesting is incrementing/decrementing a number in current line. Vim has &amp;lt;ctrl-a&amp;gt; to increment a number and &amp;lt;ctrl-x&amp;gt; to decrement a number. Just go to a line with number in it and hit &amp;lt;ctrl-a&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;ctrl-x&amp;gt; to increment/decrement. But because it is vim, there is definitely more to this command.</description>

      <description>When we write a file, how we make sure that file is written completely to disk. One of the way is write a temporary file first and then rename it, rename operation is atomic, so we get a complete file.
tempFile, err := ioutil.TempFile(path, name) if err != nil { return err } defer tempFile.Close() tempname := tempFile.Name() defer os.Remove(tempname) //Write to temp file err = os.Rename(tempname, filename) if err !</description>

      <description>Failure is a way of life. Requests(http or others..) can fail for many reasons. Decision to stop or retry can be very critical for applications. backoff algorithms provide a way to backoff and retry on a failure. There are two popular methods to backoff, constant backoff and exponential backoff.
I use backoff library, which is a Go port of exponential backoff algorithm from Google&amp;rsquo;s HTTP Client Library for Java.
backoff provides 4 main functionalities.</description>

      <description>standard streams are pre connected input and output communication channels between a program and its environment.
The three standard streams are stdin, stdout, and stderr.
File descriptors are handles that are used to access an input or output file, stream, pipe, socket, device, network interface etc. File descriptors work by providing a layer of abstraction between an actual hardware device and a special file created by the kernel for the device, populated by udev, and stored in the /dev directory.</description>

      <description>Exit codes in bash indicate the previous command&amp;rsquo;s termination status. 0 indicates that command completion was successful while 1 indicates that command execution failed.
We can check the exit code generated by last command by using $?
$ echo $? It&amp;rsquo;s not only 1 that indicates unsuccessful completion, anything greater than 1 is a sign of command failure. Standard error code are listed here:
   Exit Code Description     0 Successful execution   1 Unsuccessful execution catchall   2 Incorrect use of shell builtin   126 Command can not execute   127 Command not Found   128 Incorrect exit code argument   128 + num Fatal error signal &amp;ldquo;num&amp;rdquo;   130 Script killed with CTRL + C   255+ Exit code is out of range    Note: Exit code is an integer value between 0 and/or 255.</description>

      <description>I have been programming in Go from almost one year. I read The Go Programming Language Specification, went through A Tour of Go and looked at Effective Go many times. But when it was announced that Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan are writing a book The Go Programming Language on Go, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much and pre-ordered the book on Amazon.
I received the book on October 20, 2015 and started reading it immediately.</description>

      <title>using io.SectionReader in Go</title>

      <description>For my last task I was moving to an offset value in huge byte stream using reader.Seek(int64(offset), whence) and reading the bytes there. But it was not good for the performance because I was moving in a big file(~1gigs). Then I came to know about io.SectionReader and it made my life easier and helped me delete a lot of code(isn&amp;rsquo;t that best).
I create the section reader using this function:</description>

      <description>I got Go In Action book from William Kennedy. I was reading the book last week and I have a habit of taking some noted while reading. The book takes a very pragmatic approach to teach Go and has very good code examples. I am sharing some of the notes I took while reading the book. If anybody find the notes interesting, he/she can check the book also.
 The empty interface is an interface implemented by every type.</description>

      <title>using io.LimitReader to read a binary file</title>

      <description>I was working on a problem and wanted to read a very specific chunck of file. I read Go documentation and came through io.LimitReader. According to official documentation, &amp;ldquo;A LimitedReader reads from R but limits the amount of data returned to just N bytes. Each call to Read updates N to reflect the new amount remaining.&amp;rdquo; and this is what I wanted.
f, _ := os.Open(&amp;#34;largefile.bin&amp;#34;) f.Seek(123, 0) b := make([]byte, 150-123) // remaining length after seek  f.</description>

      <description>Go makes working with file very easy and file reading is an operation that is used very frequently.
To open a file in Go, we can use &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; function from the &amp;ldquo;os&amp;rdquo; package.
package main import ( &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; &amp;quot;os&amp;quot; ) func main() { file, err := os.Open(&amp;quot;test.txt&amp;quot;) if err != nil { fmt.Println(&amp;quot;erros is: &amp;quot;, err) return } defer file.Close() size, err := file.Stat() if err != nil { fmt.Println(&amp;quot;erros is: &amp;quot;, err) return } fs := make([]byte, size.</description>
