    <p>We all talk about an omnipotent AI that will come some time in future and might kill (hypothetically) its masters (humans in this case). I will love to have intelligent robots but I don&rsquo;t see it happening soon. What I believe will happen before AI take over the world, human++, more intelligent humans. If we look carefully we will see subtle changes and technical breakthroughs that are happening around us and pointing towards a brave new world. Some people call this phenomena &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo; but I call it human++.</p>
<p>There are many cutting edge research and experiments happening to make this a reality. Some of these are mentioned below and well worth you time to check out.</p>
<p><strong>1. Nano-bots and biological uses</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UVet-OCFdI&amp;utm">Ray Kurzweil and Robert Freitas discuss the future of nanotechnology</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Human Mind interface</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/desney/publications/BCIHCI-Chapter1.pdf">Microsoft research on brain computer interaction</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Exoskeletons</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://biomech.media.mit.edu/portfolio_page/load-bearing-exoskeleton-for-augmentation-of-human-running/">MIT media lab on exoskeleton and their usage in augmenting humans</a></p>
<p><strong>4. Fight against aging :</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_%28company%29">Google calico</a></p>
<p>All the things and others will make humans more intelligent, more resilient to disease and other medical issues, more powerful and may be someday Immortal.</p>
<p>I am no scientist or philosopher, I am just a mere human who sees the things changing around him and trying to connect the dots. It is not easy to understand what is going on but I am an optimist and believe all these changes will make humans better and might one day make us an inter galactic species.</p>
<p><strong>We all know that AI is good, but you know what is best, more intelligent humans.</strong></p>
