              <p>I really like <a href="https://aeon.co">Aeon</a> magazine. Every weekend I get aeon newsletter and there is always some really good article/essay in newsletter. One of these essay that I read today is <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-theres-no-place-like-home-for-anyone-any-more">why there is no place like home anymore</a>.This is a really thought provoking essay.</p>

<p>Essay starts by talking about <a href="https://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/">Tiny Homes</a> that I saw some time back. Tiny home is an interesting concept but I didn&rsquo;t know that you can also save tax on them. From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that these homes are on a trailer and don’t touch the ground can exempt their owners from property tax in states where they count not as homes but as a vehicle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Home is not only a place where you live, you have so many memories, you feel comfortable when in your home. That&rsquo;s why concept of home is very dear to humans(and to animals also). From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Home is where the heart is, and there is no place like home, yet a sense of being at home can come from many sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technological advances and political environment are changing the idea of a home. Things are changing fast and the idea of home is also changing. From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which makes home as important to politics as the idea of class or rights – especially now, when so many people feel displaced, both literally and figuratively, by life in innovation-driven, high-tech, networked capitalism. On top of that, the contest over where home is and who is entitled to live there, is – in the form of the current apparent crisis over migration – driving global political debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sharing economy and companies such as Airbnb(<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">https://www.airbnb.com/</a>) are turning a private place such as home into something that you share with strangers. From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bedroom can become an income-earning asset when its role in our lives is reassigned by the click of a mouse on a digital platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Young people spend most of their time on devices, even when they are home. For them being online is a form of being at home. From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Young people seem to be most at home when they are on – or perhaps ‘in’ – their phones, flicking between apps, surfing their social networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even when people do activities such as eating food etc. they are their devices with them. From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, the table in our family house has to be cleared of an Apple store’s worth of equipment before we can eat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are fearful of losing their homes because of technological advances or influx of immigrants(who are in fact looking a home for themselves). From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this fear of losing our place in the world to the technologies we’ve created will overshadow the next few decades.</p>

<p>this easily provoked fear of an imaginary pristine national home being ruined by outsiders.</p>

<p>from technology to immigration, urbanisation and climate change – the idea of home is central.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need an economic system that instead of fueling the fear of losing, creates an environment where everybody feels at home. We want good capitalism that takes everybody forward. From essay -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an economic system that helps them build a shared sense of home.</p>

<p>Capitalism needs once again to give people an orderly sense of home, rather than pitching them into insecurity, as if anything they have might be taken from them in a moment.</p>

<p>We need a new kind of shared home economics, of home-making and building. The route to power to change society starts at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A really good read and makes you realize why you like your home so much.</p>
