    <p>Testing is an integral part of software development and as a squad (if you are wondering what is a squad in software company setting, check <a href="https://vimeo.com/85490944">Spotify Culture</a>) in <a href="https://www.mediamath.com">MediaMath</a>, our mantra is that <strong>&ldquo;Regrassion Resistence is a software requirement&rdquo;</strong> and should be taken care from the start of the project. We give a lot of emphasis on testing the software and having a good test coverage. We have written some tools around <code>go coverage</code> and <code>go get</code> <a href="https://github.com/MediaMath/cove">cove</a> to help us with our testing process.</p>
<p>Go is a batteries included programming language. Go provides testing as part of standard library and that means testing is a first class citizen in Go world. Writing a test in Go is as easy as writing a function. The test function start with <strong>TestXXXXX</strong> and you can write as many tests as you want. If you have a file such as <strong>&ldquo;github_api.go&rdquo;</strong>, you can group the tests(create a test suite) for that file in a test file with a name as <strong>&ldquo;github_api_test.go&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>Go tests are run with <strong><code>go test</code></strong> command.</p>
<h5 id="a-sample-function">A Sample function:</h5>
<pre><code>package abc

func Add(a, b int) int {
	return a + b
}
</code></pre><h5 id="test-function">Test function:</h5>
<pre><code>package abc

import &quot;testing&quot;

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
	var a, b int = 2, 3
	v := Add(a, b)
	if v != 5 {
		t.Error(&quot;Expected 5, got &quot;, v)
	}
}
</code></pre><p>You can learn more about Go lang testing package at <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/testing/">testing</a>, if you want to look at the source code <a href="http://golang.org/src/testing/testing.go">testing source code</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. In Go documentation, if you want to check package documentation just use &ldquo;<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/(packagename)%22">http://golang.org/pkg/(packagename)&quot;</a> and if you want source code &ldquo;<a href="http://golang.org/src/(packagename)%22">http://golang.org/src/(packagename)&quot;</a>.</p>
